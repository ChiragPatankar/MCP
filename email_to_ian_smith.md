- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based live messaging
- **Multi-tenant System**: Secure isolation between client organizations

### Core Features
1. **Intelligent Chat System** - AI-powered responses with natural language processing
2. **Knowledge Base Management** - Document upload, website crawling, and searchable content
3. **Embeddable Widget** - Customizable chat widget for any website
4. **Analytics Dashboard** - Comprehensive reporting and conversation metrics
5. **Payment Integration** - Razorpay subscription management
6. **Multi-language Support** - 9+ languages for global reach

## Business Value
